# Overview 

This page will provide a tutorial on analyzing the class dataset for variables such as `ACI` and species richness. The level of observation will be individual recordings, which you can aggregate up (remember `group_by`) to the level of the individual stations, or attributes of stations, or other features such as month/year/etc.
