```

We will use the package `swirl` to learn more about several fundamental concepts in `R`.

## Steps

1. Log-in at [Pomona's RStudio Server](https://rstudio.pomona.edu)
2. In the console, type in `library(swirl)`
    + All subsequent steps should be run in the console.
3. Type in `swirl()`
4. You will see a message in red text, reading `| Welcome to swirl!...call yourself something unique.`
    + In the line below, you will see a prompt in blue asking `What shall I call you?`
    + Please type in your first name or nickname.
    + Note that if your name overlaps with commands in `R`, you may see functions popping up in auto-complete.
    + The image below shows this exact problem for my nickname, `Char`.
    + Type out your name and use the back-arrow to avoid auto-selecting a function or some other command if it does pop up as an auto-complete field. (This is--hopefully--very unlikely to happen!)

5. After you type in your name, you will see this message in red text. Basically, the gist of the message is that `swirl` will interact with you in the console, and any time you see three blue dots (an ellipsis), you should hit enter.
```
| Thanks, <FIRST NAME>. Let's cover a couple of quick housekeeping items...
```

6. Continue through the next two `swirl` steps, which lead to this query in red text: `| Please choose a course, or type 0 to exit swirl`
    + NB (Nota bene): By this point, `swirl` has mentioned the `R prompt (>)` several times.
    + The character `>` is an example of a **command prompt** where you tell a computer (in this case, the server hosting RStudio Server which is running `R` code) to execute your command.
    + *Examples from other languages*: In Python, the command prompt is denoted by `>>>` (if you are interacting with Python on the command line in a terminal). In Unix operating systems (e.g. Linux distributions or Mac OS), the command prompt for the terminal is often denoted by `$`.
    + TL;DR: The carat symbol `>` in the `R` console within RStudio Server is where `R` awaits your instructions (commands).
7. In response to the query (`| Please choose a course...`), type `1` after the blue text reading `Selection:`
8. In response to the next query, `| Please choose a lesson...`, please type `1` after the blue text reading `Selection:`.
    + We will be taking on the `1: Basic Building Blocks` lesson!
9. You are ready to go and learn about fundamental programming concepts in `R` using this first class in `swirl`.
10. If you encounter errors, don't worry! Just try something different and think a bit more carefully about the `swirl` instructions at that step. You can always use the vertical navigation bar on the right-hand side of the console to roll back up and see what the last instruction was. 
For example, in response to this instruction:
```
| To see another example of how this vector 'recycling' works, try
| adding c(1, 2, 3, 4) and c(0, 10). Don't worry about saving the
| result in a new variable.
```
my command here was incorrectly specified (typed in at the `R` command prompt `>`):
```
c(1, 2, 3, 4) _ c(0, 10)
```
and threw an error:
```
Error: unexpected input in "c(1, 2, 3, 4) _"
```
In this case, I ended up fixing it by typing:
```
c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)
```

Unfortunately, with these types of *syntax* errors (akin to a grammatical error in a human language, like kluging your verb conjugation and forgetting the term for a conjunction to join two clauses together), `swirl` won't jump in and "automagically" help you. 

If you get really stuck, first try entering something that is syntatically correct in the console at the command prompt. For instance, you could try `myName <- "Char"`. While this isn't the correct answer to this `swirl` instruction, because this command can be interpreted by `R`, you'll get kicked back into `swirl` instructions that may offer you something that you could directly copy and paste into the console, e.g.:
```
| That's not exactly what I'm looking for. Try again. Or, type info()
| for more options.

| Type c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) to see how R handles adding two
| vectors, when the shorter vector's length does not divide evenly
| into the longer vector's length. Don't worry about assigning the
| result to a variable.
```
(Note that here you would type or copy and paste `c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)` into the console at the command prompt `>`.)

11. If you are in the middle of interacting with the command prompt (`>`), you can exit the course and `swirl` at any time by typing `bye()` into the console.
    + Don't worry: `swirl` will save where you are in the course so you won't lose your progress!
12. The course tracks your progress: when you see the black text displaying `|=========`, the number at the right hand side, after another `|` represents the percentage of this course that you have completed.
13. At the end of the course, you will see a question from `swirl` asking:
```
| Would you like to receive credit for completing this course on
| Coursera.org?
```
I recommend typing in `2` (representing "No") at the `Selection:` field.

14. Afterwards, `swirl` will tell you that you've completed the course, you will see the following in red text:
```
| Excellent work!
| You've reached the end of this lesson...
| Please choose a course, or type 0 to exit swirl.
```
In response to the blue `Selection:` query, please type 0.

15. When you have completed the first `swirl` course, please navigate to the [Gradescope POM](https://sakai.claremont.edu/portal/directtool/cf1b6e41-4bb4-47f6-824d-a35660ddf375/) subpage in our Sakai site and select the correct option for the `Completion of swirl class (Basic Building Blocks)` assignment.

**If you have been working on this swirl class for an amount of time that feels really excessive (e.g. > 2 hours), please don't keep on hitting your head against the wall.** Reach out to me via Slack DM or email.
