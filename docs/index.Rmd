# Overview

![](figures/OverviewDiagram.jpeg)
If these are questions that you find urgent, exciting, or otherwise fascinating, then you have come to the right class to explore these topics further. Recent studies estimate that as many as 10-50% of all species on Earth are at risk of extinction. Different anthropogenic activities such as land conversion for agriculture or the exploitation of natural resources such as fisheries and bushmeat pose major threats to biodiversity.

Ultimately, the threats facing species and ecosystems are driven by human behaviors and societal decisions. Finding solutions therefore requires the combination of the social sciences alongside ecology. Most of the material that we will cover in class will take the form of conceptual models linked to "lessons learned" from conservation successes or failures. The course will be centered on discussions and collaborative group work. In this course, you will also be introduced to key computational tools used by conservation scientists and you will apply these skills in your own projects.

* *Reading*: You will interpret, synthesize, extend, and question core principles in conservation biology and science.
* *Communication and Presentation*: Describing complex issues with clarity and persuasion is a highly translatable skill. This course will offer many opportunities to further develop your presentation skills, including speed presentations on readings and group presentations.
* *Synthesis*: Creating socio-ecological conceptual models is a critical skill for conservation science. This course will allow you to build your skills in concept-mapping and interpreting claims in the literature.
* *Grant writing*: Developing compelling hypotheses, situating your claims in the literature, and requesting financial support for your science is an important and highly transferable skill.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the course, a successful learner will be able to:

1. define biodiversity, describe trends pertinent to global biodiversity, and arguments to conserve biodiversity;
2. critically review evidence for causes of biodiversity declines;
3. evaluate different strategies to effectively mitigate biodiversity decline;
4. discuss the use of science in conservation practice and consider the role of personal and social norms and values in conservation.

## General information

**Location**: 

Seaver Biology Room 111

**Schedule**: Mondays and Wednesdays 11am-12:15pm

**Office Hours**: My regularly scheduled office hours will be **Tuesdays, 12:30-2pm** in my office (Seaver South 108). Times outside of my standard office hours can be scheduled on a [first-come-first-served basis here](https://cal.com/chchang47/30min).

**Prerequisites**: Bio 41E (Intro Ecol & Evolutionary Bio w/Lab) or instructor permission

**Readings**: This course will use a combination of the primary literature, popular science books, and the free, online textbook [*Conservation Biology for All*](https://conbio.org/publications/free-textbook).

**AI policy**: This course assumes that all work submitted by students will be generated by the students themselves, working individually or in groups. Students should not have another person/entity do the writing of any substantive portion of an assignment for them, which includes hiring a person or a company to write assignments and using artificial intelligence tools like Copilot, ChatGPT and Google Bard.

*Note*: In the longer term, generative AI is extremely expensive for these companies to run and has a substantial environmental and power demand footprint. It is also unclear if companies providing these services will be able to procure enough electricity to be able to meet all consumer demand for this service. *Therefore, relying on generative AI* puts you at the mercy of large companies that have no accountability to the public, and can harm your growth for near-term convenience that becomes a long-term liability when access to these tools disappears (e.g. companies decide they are a money pit and cut them as a service--see [Google Graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com/) for some examples) or is only accessible behind prohibitive paywalls (e.g. your organization must subscribe and pay USD\$50,000-\$100,000 or more for some recurring subscription).

**Digital ethics**: One of the tools we will use from time to time in this course is Zoom. To facilitate access, I will typically record Zoom meetings. I will inform students when recordings are in progress. I expect that students in my class will respect one another and my privacy. To that end, students will not record any other member of the class--including the instructor--without obtaining their consent in advance. Students will also not share information about other members of this course in any type of public fora, such as social media. As the instructor, I own the copyright to my instructional materials. These materials cannot be distributed in whole or in part to any person or entity other than other members of the current class without my prior written consent.

## Mutual expectations

### What I expect from you

I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability - and other visible and non-visible differences. As an instructor, I strongly emphasize student agency; this class is **your** learning journey, and as such, I expect students to take leadership in their own learning and to keep track of assignments and examination dates. I expect we will respectfully consider differing opinions and engage in constructive discourse. As such, I expect that everyone will help create a collegial environment where all students feel welcome and their rights to learn are respected. Please refer to the [Pomona College Student Code](http://catalog.pomona.edu/content.php?catoid=38&navoid=7668) for official policy.

### What you can expect from me

I will strive to provide an equitable and inclusive learning environment. My overarching goal is to help you succeed in your exploration of conservation. To that end, you can expect me to be responsive to your concerns about course content, delivery style, and suggestions on how I can improve this course. 

A key component of my role as an instructor is office hours. During office hours, I am available to help you work through any problems, questions, or thoughts you have about the course. I am also more than happy to chat about broader questions such as career paths in conservation, next steps after Pomona College/the Claremont Colleges, or other topics of interest to you.

## General course policies

*Office hours, email, and class Slack channel*: During office hours, I am available to help you work through any problems, questions, or thoughts you have about the course. 

I have email boundaries and I encourage you to find your own. Mine include not answering emails after 6pm, or on weekends or holidays. Finally, I request that emails only be used for interactions that are truly one-on-one (e.g. requesting extensions to assignments or accommodations); in general, to help create an atmosphere of transparency and group learning, I request that **questions about content and assignments be directed to the #bio104a Slack channel** in the Pomona College Division-II workspace.

*Learning diversity & accommodations*: Pomona College welcomes and accommodates students with disabilities. As your instructor, I care about you and your growth as an environmental scholar. If you encounter obstacles to your success, please let me know immediately so that we can work together to identify ways to overcome any limitations of current course design. If you feel you need a reasonable accommodation to participate in this class, complete course requirements, or benefit from the College’s programs or services, you are also welcome to contact the student accessibility resource office at your College to begin this conversation or to establish accommodations for this or other courses.

Below is a list of the relevant accessibility resource offices at each of the Colleges:

1. [Claremont McKenna College (CMC) Accessibility Services](https://www.cmc.edu/dean-of-students/accessibility-services)
2. [Harvey Mudd College (HMC) Disability Resources Office](https://www.hmc.edu/student-life/disability-resources/)
3. [Pitzer College (PZ) Academic Support Services](https://www.pitzer.edu/student-life/academic-support-services/)
4. [Pomona College (POM) Student Accessibility Resources and Services Office](https://www.pomona.edu/accessibility/student-accessibility)
5. [Scripps College (SC) Accommodations for Students with Disabilities](https://www.scrippscollege.edu/academics/students-with-disabilities)
6. [The 7 College (7C) Student Disability Resource Center](https://services.claremont.edu/sdrc/) and [7C Student Disability Resource Center email](mailto:SDRC@claremont.edu)

*Writing center and student support services*: I urge all students to make use of your home campus’ Writing Center and other student support services. A list of relevant resources in included below. For example, the Writing Center is a great resource to workshop and improve your writing whether that is for classwork, for public consumption (e.g. op-eds), graduate school or funding applications, or any other domain.

1. [CMC Center for Writing and Public Discourse](https://www.cmc.edu/writing) 
2. [HMC Writing Center](https://www.hmc.edu/learning-programs/writing-center/)
3. [POM Writing Center](https://www.pomona.edu/administration/writing-center)
4. [PZ Writing Center](https://www.pitzer.edu/writing-center/)
5. [SC Writing Center](https://www.scrippscollege.edu/departments/writing-program/writing-center)

*Late assignments*:  When assignments are handed in late without prior notice, I reserve the right to apply a grade deduction penalty (~1 grade reduction for each day late; 4 or more days late translates to a failing grade).

*Academic integrity*: Academic honesty is a core value of Pomona College and the Claremont Colleges. Plagiarism undermines academic integrity and is a threat to communal ethics. I will assign plagiarized assignments a failing grade and will report any instance of plagiarism to the College.

## Course Schedule

Please note that this schedule is subject to change; this syllabus is very much a *living document* that will change to reflect the unique conditions of this semester. I reserve the right to exercise some flexibility in scheduling, usually in favor of giving more time to students.

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
library(dplyr)
library(googlesheets4)
library(htmlTable)
library(knitr)
library(flextable)

## Pull in Google sheet schedule
schedDF <- googlesheets4::read_sheet("
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JIh8EzjAGdTWxuCF7ha7yI4RTIGbn0Smq4EpV5WTtWo/edit?usp=sharing",sheet = "Schedule",col_types="ccccc")

## Hack-y workaround to do zebra banding color automagically (based on NA values)
zebra_cols <- rep("none",dim(schedDF)[1])
zebra_cols[which(is.na(schedDF$Topic))] <- "#adc2d8"

#ft <- flextable(schedDF)
#ft <- theme_vanilla(ft)
#ft

schedDF$Week[1] <- "1  "

schedDF %>% 
  addHtmlTableStyle(col.rgroup = zebra_cols,
                    align = "llccc",
                    css.cell = "border-bottom: solid 0.5px",
                    css.cgroup=c("width: 1000px;","width: 300px;","width: 300px;","width: 300px;","width: 300px;")) %>% # doesn't make a difference! must be getting overridden by knitr.
  htmlTable(rnames=FALSE) # can't figure out for now how to merge cells - whatever
```
