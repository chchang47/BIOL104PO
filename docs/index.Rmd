# Overview

![](figures/OverviewDiagram.jpeg)
If these are questions that you find urgent, exciting, or otherwise fascinating, then you have come to the right class to explore these topics further. Recent studies estimate that as many as 10-50% of all species on Earth are at risk of extinction. Different anthropogenic activities such as land conversion for agriculture or the exploitation of natural resources such as fisheries and bushmeat pose major threats to biodiversity.

Ultimately, the threats facing species and ecosystems are driven by human behaviors and societal decisions. Finding solutions therefore requires the combination of the social sciences alongside ecology. Most of the material that we will cover in class will take the form of conceptual models linked to "lessons learned" from conservation successes or failures. The course will be centered on discussions and collaborative group work. In this course, you will also be introduced to key computational tools used by conservation scientists and you will apply these skills in your own projects.

* *Reading*: You will interpret, synthesize, extend, and question core principles in conservation biology and science.
* *Communication and Presentation*: Describing complex issues with clarity and persuasion is a highly translatable skill. This course will offer many opportunities to further develop your presentation skills, including speed presentations on readings and group presentations.
* *Synthesis*: Creating socio-ecological conceptual models is a critical skill for conservation science. This course will allow you to build your skills in concept-mapping and interpreting claims in the literature.
* *Data management, analysis, and visualization*: This course has a computational component where you will be able to develop skills in statistical programming using the `R` programming language. I do not assume any prior experience with programming.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the course, a successful learner will be able to:

1. define biodiversity, describe trends pertinent to global biodiversity, and arguments to conserve biodiversity;
2. critically review evidence for causes of biodiversity declines;
3. evaluate different strategies to effectively mitigate biodiversity decline;
4. discuss the use of science in conservation practice and consider the role of personal and social norms and values in conservation.

## General information

**Location**: 

* Lecture: Seaver South Room 52
* Lab: Seaver South Room 48
  + NB: If you ever need to join by Zoom, you can find the lecture or lab Zoom call information at the [Sakai Zoom Pomona tab](https://sakai.claremont.edu/portal/directtool/87d58019-011c-493a-a8da-94adf24b4e84/).

**Schedule**: Tuesdays & Thursdays, 9:35-10:50am PT (January-May 2022), Labs Thursdays 1:15-5pm PT

**Office Hours**: My regularly scheduled office hours will be Tuesdays from 1:00-3:00pm. I am always happy to talk to you. You can find me at my office or lab. In case you'd like to use Zoom, I recommend giving me a heads up at my [Calendly](https://calendly.com/chchang47/small-group-meetings).

**Prerequisites**: Bio 41E (Intro Ecol & Evolutionary Bio w/Lab) or instructor permission

**Readings**: This course will use a combination of the primary literature, popular science books, and the free, online textbook [*Conservation Biology for All*](https://conbio.org/publications/free-textbook).

**Student Well-Being**: Our health, both mental and physical, is paramount. In an era where we are still impacted by COVID19, we must consider the health of others inside and outside the classroom. Class attendance is important, but if you need to miss class for health reasons, concerning symptoms, suspected COVID exposure, unexpected dependent care, technology issues, or other emergency reasons I will work with you. Let me underscore this: **please make your decisions always based on health, safety, and wellness—yours and others**—and I will work with you at the other end. *Take any potential symptoms seriously; we’re counting on each other.*

In addition to the course policies below, I prioritize your health and well-being. Physical or mental illness, personal crises, family care, and other responsibilities can strongly impact your ability to participate in this course. Please let me and/or staff in the Student Affairs or related offices know if any of these issues pose severe obstacles to you and we will work together to come up with solutions. I am also more than happy to work with you and a representative from Student Affairs in situations where sensitive information is involved.

**Digital ethics**: One of the tools we will use from time to time in this course is Zoom. To facilitate access, I will typically record Zoom meetings. I will inform students when recordings are in progress. I expect that students in my class will respect one another and my privacy. To that end, students will not record any other member of the class--including the instructor--without obtaining their consent in advance. Students will also not share information about other members of this course in any type of public fora, such as social media. As the instructor, I own the copyright to my instructional materials. These materials cannot be distributed in whole or in part to any person or entity other than other members of the current class without my prior written consent.

## Mutual expectations

### What I expect from you

I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability - and other visible and non-visible differences. As an instructor, I strongly emphasize student agency; this class is **your** learning journey, and as such, I expect students to take leadership in their own learning and to keep track of assignments and examination dates. I expect we will respectfully consider differing opinions and engage in constructive discourse. As such, I expect that everyone will help create a collegial environment where all students feel welcome and their rights to learn are respected. Please refer to the [Pomona College Student Code](http://catalog.pomona.edu/content.php?catoid=38&navoid=7668) for official policy.

### What you can expect from me

I will strive to provide an equitable and inclusive learning environment. My overarching goal is to help you succeed in your exploration of conservation. To that end, you can expect me to be responsive to your concerns about course content, delivery style, and suggestions on how I can improve this course. 

A key component of my role as an instructor is office hours. During office hours, I am available to help you work through any problems, questions, or thoughts you have about the course. I am also more than happy to chat about broader questions such as career paths in conservation, next steps after Pomona College/the Claremont Colleges, or other topics of interest to you.

## General course policies

*Office hours, email, and class Slack channel*: During office hours, I am available to help you work through any problems, questions, or thoughts you have about the course. If you would like to discuss a particular problem or topic that would benefit from preparation on my part, please give me advance notice via [Calendly](https://calendly.com/chchang47/small-group-meetings). 

I have email boundaries and I encourage you to find your own. Mine include not answering emails after 6pm, or on weekends or holidays. Finally, I request that emails only be used for interactions that are truly one-on-one (e.g. requesting extensions to assignments or accommodations); in general, to help create an atmosphere of transparency and group learning, I request that **questions about content and assignments be directed to the #bio104sp23 Slack channel** in the Pomona College Division-II workspace.

*Learning diversity & accommodations*: Pomona College welcomes and accommodates students with disabilities. As your instructor, I care about you and your growth as an environmental scholar. If you encounter obstacles to your success, please let me know immediately so that we can work together to identify ways to overcome any limitations of current course design. If you feel you need a reasonable accommodation to participate in this class, complete course requirements, or benefit from the College’s programs or services, you are also welcome to contact the student accessibility resource office at your College to begin this conversation or to establish accommodations for this or other courses.

*Academic integrity*: Academic honesty is a core value of Pomona College and the Claremont Colleges. Plagiarism undermines academic integrity and is a threat to communal ethics. I will assign plagiarized assignments a failing grade and will report any instance of plagiarism to the College.

## Course Schedule

Please note that this schedule is subject to change; this syllabus is very much a *living document* that will change to reflect the unique conditions of this semester. I reserve the right to exercise some flexibility in scheduling, usually in favor of giving more time to students.

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
library(dplyr)
library(googlesheets4)
library(htmlTable)
library(knitr)
library(flextable)

## Pull in Google sheet schedule
schedDF <- googlesheets4::read_sheet("
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JIh8EzjAGdTWxuCF7ha7yI4RTIGbn0Smq4EpV5WTtWo/edit?usp=sharing",sheet = "Schedule",col_types="ccccc")

## Hack-y workaround to do zebra banding color automagically (based on NA values)
zebra_cols <- rep("none",dim(schedDF)[1])
zebra_cols[which(is.na(schedDF$Topic))] <- "#adc2d8"

#ft <- flextable(schedDF)
#ft <- theme_vanilla(ft)
#ft

schedDF$Week[1] <- "1  "

schedDF %>% 
  addHtmlTableStyle(col.rgroup = zebra_cols,
                    align = "llccc",
                    css.cell = "border-bottom: solid 0.5px",
                    css.cgroup=c("width: 1000px;","width: 100px;","width: 300px;","width: 100px;","width: 300px;")) %>% # doesn't make a difference! must be getting overridden by knitr.
  htmlTable(rnames=FALSE) # can't figure out for now how to merge cells - whatever
```
