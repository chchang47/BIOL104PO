## Having some fun with `R`

Anytime `R` detects a syntax (spelling or programming language "grammar") error, it will spit out some kind of `warning` or `error` message. Usually the `warning` messages indicate that things are working, but maybe something weird could be happening (e.g. you think you have successfully fit a statistical model, but actually, the data are too few to perform a solid estimation of the model coefficients, so `R` starts squawking). 

`Error` messages usually pertain to `R` 1) not being able to find some variable/object (spelling issues most often - and here is an example of a place where I already run into issues - I tend to use variable/object interchangeably when talking about items I am creating or defining in `R`) or 2) not being able to execute some function (usually because something is written incorrectly, spelled wrong, you're missing a closing parenthesis/bracket, or you have an extra parenthesis/bracket hanging out).

So, while we may throw our hands up in despair when we see an inscrutable and alarming-sounding `R` warning or error, let's turn this into a friendly class competition instead! [This Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mW6TsqO4IVRmawhp0D4UIyGkKDz3C0QLUJ0QBk_DY2Y/edit?usp=sharing) is where we can submit our own worst error and warning messages.

Don't worry! You won't break `R`. Running into error messages and warnings is a sign of growth. I still get error messages and warnings pretty much every day I sit down and code. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Interacting with datasets using the `dplyr` package

In this class, we will use the [Tidyverse](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) developed by RStudio statisticians and `R` aficianados. Relative to other ways of interacting with data in ("base") `R`, the Tidyverse has the advantage of featuring syntax that more directly translates to other data science tool kits and languages, such as Python or SQL. [`dplyr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/) is one of the Tidyverse packages that extends core `R` functions to make `R` more modern and elegant in interacting with real-world data.

This [data file](https://github.com/charlottehchang/BIOL104PO/blob/master/data/StateSpeciesDatasetS21.csv) will be used in this `R` module. This dataset consists of the following state-level observations, denoted by each of the column names below:

* `State`: Name of each state (2-character abbreviation)
* `TotX`: Total species richness (# of species) for each taxon:
  + `TotMammals` - total mammalian richness in each state
  + `TotBirds` - all birds (lower than official state counts, which include vagrants and other rarities)
  + `TotVerts` - all vertebrates, excluding mammals and birds
  + `TotInverts` - all invertebrates
  + `TotVascPlants` - all vascular plants
  + `TotNonVascPlants` - all non-vascular plants (e.g. mosses, liverworts)
* `EndX`: species richness of endemic species
  + Replace X with each of the taxonomic groups listed above (e.g. EndMammals, EndBirds, etc.)
* `ThreatX`: number of threatened species in each state in each group
  + Replace `X` with each of the taxonomic groups listed above (e.g. `ThreatVascPlants`, `ThreatBirds`, etc.)
* `StateLandAreaMi2`: Land area of each state in square miles
* `FarmAcresYYYY`: Land in farms in units of 1000 acres (therefore, multiply each state value by 1000 to get units in acres)
  + Replace `YYYY` with one of the following years: `2018, 2002, 1997`
  + Variable names: `FarmAcres2018, FarmAcres2002, FarmAcres1997`
* `CostPerAcreYYYY`: USD$ per acre for farmland in each state in eaach year
  + Replace `YYYY` with one of the following years: 2019, 2003, 1997
  + Variable names: `CostPerAcre2019, CostPerAcre2003, CostPerAcre1997`
* `TotalProtectedAreaAcres`: Total amount of area protected in each state in acres
* `PopulationYYYY`: Census-based population size for each state in each census year
  + Replace `YYYY` with one of the following years: `2020, 2010, 2000`
  + Variable names: `Population2020, Population2010, Population2000`
* `GrossStateProduct`: gross domestic product by state in units of 1 million USD (therefore, multiply each value by `10^6` to get the state GDP in dollars)

## Data operations

One of the core data types that is integral to the modern world is spreadsheet-like data organized into a matrix format. In `R` parlance, such data are typically represented by a type of object called a `data.frame`. In many contexts, these types of data are also called data tables.

In this module, we will focus on the following types of queries for data tables:

* `filter()`: subsetting a data table based on values in **rows**
* `select()`: subset a data table based on specific **columns** given by their names
* `arrange()`: sort rows based on values in columns
* `mutate()`: create new columns for a data table based on some operation applied to existing columns
* `summarize()`: summarize data table, usually yielding a data table with fewer rows

## Scripting

Today, we will also embark on writing `R` scripts to store our commands. We will even be able to execute the code interactively from the script editor (much like a text editor or some other type of notepad).

## Steps

1. Navigate to [https://rstudio.pomona.edu](https://rstudio.pomona.edu)
2. If you have not yet done so, I recommend naming your current session. You can do that as follows:

![2a) Clicking on the session menu in the upper right-hand corner](figures/NamingRSession.png)

![2b) Providing a name for the current R session](figures/WritingSessionName.png)

3. Opening up a new `.R` script
    + Note that you can navigate to the bars in between each pane until you see a `r fa("arrows-alt", fill="black")` icon, which you can use to drag the panes to be larger or smaller 

![3a) Opening up the script pane](figures/openingRscript.png)

![3b) R script editor pane](figures/Rscript.png)

4. Creating a folder to store our work in BIOL104:
    + In the bottom right-hand corner (Viewer/Plots/Files pane), click on `Files`
    + Click on `New Folder`
    + Give your folder a name. I recommend `BIOL104`
5. Click in the text editor pane in the top left-hand side, which currently says `Untitled1` at the top.
6. Subsequently, copy the code below into the `R` script:
    + Note that below, any line starting with the pound sign `#` is a *comment*.
    + Comments are text that are not executed by `R`.
    + In general, it is good practice to "comment your code" -- that is, use comments to annotate your code for future reference.
    
```
### Loading packages with helpful functions
library(dplyr) 
  # R will let you know if loading in this package over-rides any existing function names; don't worry about this message for now.

### Reading in data
USdata <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlottehchang/BIOL104PO/master/data/StateSpeciesDatasetS21.csv") # Here, we are using the function read_csv from the package readr
    # R will print out a message saying how it has parsed the data table into different columns

### Previewing the data
USdata

### Subsetting our data by rows
filter(USdata, ThreatMammals >= 50) # select all rows (each row is a state) where there are 10 or more threatened mammals
filter(USdata, State=="CA" | State=="AZ") # select all rows corresponding to the states of California OR Arizona. The vertical bar (|) denotes an "OR" operation
filter(USdata, TotMammals > 50 & TotBirds > 400) # select all rows with more than 50 mammals and more than 400 birds

### Selecting columns from the data table
select(USdata, EndVascPlants) # Here, we are selecting the column of endemic vascular plant richness counts
select(USdata, FarmAcres2018) # Here, we are selecting the column storing the number of acres of land (in units of 1000 acres)
select(USdata, TotBirds, EndBirds) # Here, we are selecting two columns from US data - total bird richness and endemic bird richness

### Sorting the data table based on the level of threatened bird richness
dplyr::arrange(USdata, ThreatBirds) # the :: is R syntax to refer to a function from a package; I wanted to show this explicitly here.
  # Sometimes it is necessary when multiple packages have functions of the same name. Then if you load a second package after dplyr that also has an "arrange" function, that package's arrange function would be the default one that you call on.

### Creating new variables and storing them in new columns
thousand_acres_to_miles <- 1.56 # multiplier to convert 1000 acres to square miles
USdata <- mutate(USdata, FarmAcres2018Mi2 = FarmAcres2018*thousand_acres_to_miles) # taking the conversion rate for 1000 acres to units of square miles and creating a new variable that stores farm area in each state in square miles
    # Ensure that we store this output in the variable USdata, so that way the new column will show up when we call or refer to USdata
USdata <- mutate(USdata, FarmProportion = FarmAcres2018Mi2/StateLandAreaMi2)
  ## Getting a summary of our new FarmProportion column
summary( select(USdata, FarmProportion) )  # Summarize the proportion of land that is farm area across the 50 states.

### Creating a summary across a subset of data
summarize(USdata, min_number_threatened_birds = min(ThreatBirds), 
mean_number_threatened_birds = mean(ThreatBirds),
max_number_threatened_birds = max(ThreatBirds)) # Creating a small table that summarizes the minimum and maximum species richness of threatened bird species across the 50 states
```

When you've copied in the code into the `R` script, it will look something like this:

![R script with initial commands](figures/InitialRScript.png)

7. Next, save the `Untitled1` file using the `r fa("save")` icon and give it an informative name.
    + I recommend selecting the `BIOL104` folder (or whatever you previously named the folder) as the location to save this file.
    + I went ahead and gave this file the name `Week2.R`
8. Now you can run the code **from the script editor directly**! 
9. The easiest way to run the code is to highlight each line of code and either type `⌘ + Enter` (people who have Mac OS) or `CTRL + Enter`

You can also highlight each line of code with your mouse and use the "run code" button at the top right-hand side of the text editor pane:
![run code](figures/runCode.png)

10. Note that running each line of code from the text editor (from the `R` script in this case) is the same as typing the commands into the console. You typed commands directly into the console last week in your initial interactions with `R`.
11. Writing scripts is advantageous because you can store your commands somewhere convenient and revisit or edit the file anytime.

### Going further

Congratulations on several exciting achievements! You have 1) read in data from an online source into `R`, 2) learned how to perform different operations to select rows or columns from the data, and 3) started to see how to summarize your data.

To help you make forward progress, here are several **completely optional** exercises. If you'd like to work through these examples, please feel free to reach out to me via Slack DM if you encounter any obstacles.

I recommend using the `Week2.R` script as a scratch space to work through these questions if you have time and decide to take on these example questions.

1. How would you subset (filter) rows from `USdata` where `TotVerts` is greater than or equal to 100?
    + Note that you can use the command `names(USdata)` (you can add this to your script or run it any time in the console) to see the names of all of the columns in your data table
2. How would you subset (select) the column `CostPerAcre1997` from `USdata`?
3. How would you subset rows from `USdata` where `ThreatInverts` is $\geq 250$ **and** subset your data to the columns `ThreatInverts` and `EndInverts`?
4. How would you create (mutate) a new column in `USdata` that stores the amount of protected areas in each state in units of square miles instead of acres?
    + Note that `TotalProtectedAreasAcres` presents the total acreage of protected lands in each state. The units are acres, not 1000 acres.
5. Building on point D above, how would you create a column that stores the proportion of land protected in each state?
6. How would you summarize the minimum (`min()`), mean (`mean()`), and maximum (`max()`) values for the proportion of land that is protected in each state?

## Combining operations using "pipes"

What if you wanted to combine functions above and store the final products? For example, let's say that we wanted to:

1. Calculate the proportion of land in each state that is protected.
2. Based on those proportional land protection levels, assign a "protection status" category for each state (e.g. low, medium, and high protection).
3. Compare the number of endemic invertebrates and plants across these three categories of states.

In `R`, you could write up those commands individually as follows (copy and paste into your scripting pane to save and run these commands line by line):

```
### 1: Calculating the proportion of land in each state that is protected
  # Note that all of the code here assumes that you have run the first 3 R commands from the previous "code chunk"
  # The first 3 commands loaded the dplyr package, pulled in the data for this week's R component, and displayed (printed) the data in the console by calling the dataset's name (USdata)
acres_to_miles <- 1.56/1000 # multiplier to convert 1 acre to square miles
USdata_with_land_protection <- mutate(USdata, proportion_land_protected = (TotalProtectedAreasAcres * acres_to_miles)/StateLandAreaMi2 ) # we have created a new column "proportion_land_protected" that stores the output of our conversion of protected areas in acres to square miles, then divides that quantity by the total land area (in miles^2) of each state.
  # We are storing the output of this analysis in a new object, USdata_with_land_protection (not USdata). You could also store it in USdata though. But why might you sometimes want to store it in the original variable (USdata), and why might you sometimes want to create a new variable/object?

### 2: Assigning a "protected status" category for each state
USdata_with_land_protection <- mutate(USdata_with_land_protection,
State_category=case_when(proportion_land_protected <= 0.2 ~ "Low",
proportion_land_protected <= 0.5 ~ "Medium",
proportion_land_protected > 0.5 ~ "High")) # Here I am using another nifty function in dplyr, "case_when" to assign some kind of a label / category based on the values in the column proportion_land_protected, and I'm storing those categories in a new column called State_category.

### 3: Comparing the number of endemic invertebrates and plants across those three categories of state protection status
comparisonDF <- summarize( group_by(USdata_with_land_protection, State_category), EndemicInverts = mean(EndInverts),
EndemicPlants = mean(EndVascPlants + EndNonVascPlants))

comparisonDF # call the object to print out its values
```

Alternatively, you could use the pipe operator `%>%` to daisy chain commands together into a sequence. It is a handy way to make a complex operation with intermediate steps more transparent. The visualization below describes what pipes do in `R` in linking up functions:

![Schematic of the pipe `%>%` operator in `R` (Altaf Ali)](figures/Rpipeoperator.png)

We could redo the commands above using the pipe operator as follows:

```
acres_to_miles <- 1.56/1000 # multiplier to convert 1 acre to square miles 
  # You don't need to re-copy and re-run this line if you already defined this object before in your R session
  
comparisonDF <- USdata %>% # passing the object USdata to the next command
    mutate(proportion_land_protected = (TotalProtectedAreasAcres * acres_to_miles)/StateLandAreaMi2 ) %>% # I don't need to refer to the USdata object! mutate() knows to use that object. Instead, I can directly refer to the new column I want to create from existing columns.
    mutate(State_category=case_when(proportion_land_protected <= 0.2 ~ "Low",
proportion_land_protected <= 0.5 ~ "Medium",
proportion_land_protected > 0.5 ~ "High")) %>%
  group_by(State_category) %>%
  summarize(EndemicInverts = mean(EndInverts),
EndemicPlants = mean(EndVascPlants + EndNonVascPlants))

comparisonDF

# Note that in this code chunk, we didn't define the USdata_with_land_protection object. We didn't need to have some intermediate variable to store the intermediate outputs!
# Note also that if you call USdata again, you wouldn't see these new columns (e.g. proportion_land_protected) in that data table. That's because we never assigned the output of mutate back to the USdata object (this can be a good thing when you don't care or don't want intermediate data outputs to muck up your original data)
```
